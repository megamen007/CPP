// An accessor is a member function that allows someone to retrieve the contents of a protected data member
// The accessor must have the same type as the returned variable
// The accessor does not need to have arguments

// In practice, all attributes of a class are private.
// Getters are the interface between the user and private attributes,
// to be sure that the values are always correct.
